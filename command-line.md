From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Finder on Mac OS or Windows Explorer on Windows.
The difference is that the command line is fully text-based.
(1) cd: CHANGE TO A DIFFERENT DIRECTORY 
(2) ls: LIST THE THINGS IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY 
(3) mkdir: MAKE A NEW DIRECTORY 
(4) pwd: PRINTING OUT THE CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY 
(5) touch: CREAT AN EMPTY FILE IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY 
(6) open: OPEN THE FILE OF THE TYPING ARGUMENT 
(7) rm: REMOVE THE FILE FROM DIRECTORY 
(8) mv: RENAME A FILE 
(9) rm-r: REMOVE THE WHOLE DIRECTORY 
(10): cd /: GOING BACK TO THE ROOT DIRECTORY
